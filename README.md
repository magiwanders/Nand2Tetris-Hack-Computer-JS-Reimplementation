# Nand2Tetris-Hack-Computer-JS-Reimplementation
This is a minimalist/barebones in-browser javascript simulator of the famous Nand2Tetris course Hack Computer. It provides much control over the execution of programs and a better performance than the java implementation provided with the course (although with much less complementar functionality).

TODO:
- Implement simple assembler so that assembly code can be directly input into the webpage.
- Improve graphic design (virtually non-existant right now).
- Create a keyboard buffer layer.

Feel free to fork or contribute!
